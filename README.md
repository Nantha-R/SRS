# SRS
The proposed algorithm is to recommend users with the reviews that will be
most suitable for each user and vary from one user to another based on multiple
criteria. The system consists of a website for providing recommendations about
various fields like education, tourism, sports etc. Reviews are processed and
analysed using various methods to give collaborative results that are most
appropriate and accurate.

The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
1) Providing the user with the reviews given by his/her facebook friends.
2) Providing the user with the reviews that are given from the same
geographical location of the user.
3) Providing the user a choice to view only the Good or Bad reviews about
an object which has been reviewed.
4) Providing the user with the reviews that are more meaningful using
sentimental analysis.
5) Providing the user with the reviews that are given about a particular
attribute.
6) Providing the users with reviews that are most suited to them using aggregated results of all the methods that are discussed above.
